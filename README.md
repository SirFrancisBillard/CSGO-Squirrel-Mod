# CSGO Squirrel Mod
No, it is NOT a mod that adds furry creatures into CSGO. It is support for scripting using Squirrel, a VScript language for CSGO.

# How to use
Simply download the repository as a ZIP and extract to your CSGO folder.

If you wish to execute any scripts using this plugin on your server, put the following in autoexec.cfg:
exec csgo-squirrel-mod/main
This will set up all necessary assets this mod uses. You will be able to execute your scripts normally.

If you wish to embed any scripts you make into a map, name them the same as the map (Example: de_dust2.nut) and place them in the same folder as the bsp. The next time you use pakrat on the map, the script should be included.
