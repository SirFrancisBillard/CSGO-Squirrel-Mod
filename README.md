# CSGO Squirrel Mod
No, it is NOT a mod that adds furry creatures into CSGO. It is support for scripting using Squirrel, a VScript language for CSGO.

# How to use
Simply download the repository as a ZIP and extract to your CSGO folder.
When making a map, place the CSGO-Squirrel-Mod prefab into your map.
If you make your script correctly, the rest will be done for you.
